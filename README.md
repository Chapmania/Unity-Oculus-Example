# Unity-Oculus-Example
An example of how to use Oculus Integration in VR

## Requirements
* Unity 2019.1.14f1 - This will probably work with other versions, but this is the version I am working with.
* Oculus Integration 1.38 - **DO NOT USE THE VERSION FROM THE UNITY ASSET STORE!**  Download from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/unity-integration-archive/

## Purpose
There have been a lot of changes to the VR landscame in the last few months.  As of this writing, there are many tutorials out there today that show how to get started, but each one is slightly out of date.  This project pulls together all the things I know about getting a starter project up and running with:
* Animated hands
* Thumbstick locomotion
* Geometry collision
* Simple grabbing of objects
